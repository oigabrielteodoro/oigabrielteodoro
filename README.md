I started programming at the age of 13 and since then my passion for technology has only increased.

Today I use JavaScript/TypeScript and the entire ecosystem around this technology. My current focus is on Frontend, but I have Backend and Mobile skills.


My favorite quote is: "The greatest talent anyone can have is dedication and persistence"
